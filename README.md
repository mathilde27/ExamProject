# ExamProject
Description and motivation:
The main purpose of the app is to identify plants via camera/picture and view information about them. 
The care instructions must be available as part of the information. 
The user should be able to create a collection of ones plants/flowers.
Reminders to e.g. water the plants is a key feature of the application.
